<h1>Spotify Song Genre Prediction</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project aimed to predict song genres using the spotifyr package dataset, encompassing 32,833 observations and 23 variables. The project involved data standardization for uniform scaling and applied statistical techniques, such as removing zero-variance and highly correlated predictors. Through tuning K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest models and comparing their performance with Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), the project determined the most effective model for song genre prediction. This project offered insights into music genre classification and served as an exploration of machine learning techniques in music data analysis.
